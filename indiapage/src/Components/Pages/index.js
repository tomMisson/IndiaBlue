          <p>
                I am a Faerie-Folk artist from Kent who brings magical music to the human realm. With an array of instruments and a unique voice similar to the likes of Kate Bush and Joanna Newson, my songs are haunting yet soothing.   
                To date, I have played at events like The Sussex Faerie Festival, Green Gathering, Small World and the Mystical Markets. I was also a runner up in the 2015 Young Songwriter of the Year and attended the Area Finals of Open Mic UK.
